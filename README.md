# LLM Sentence Completion Response Classifier Study!

## Project Overview
This study explores the classification of responses generated by different Large Language Models (LLMs) using machine learning techniques. We developed classifiers to distinguish between outputs from four diverse LLMs: **ChatGPT4o**, **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**, **Llama 3.1 405B**, and **Qwen2.5-72B**.

## Dataset
- **325 unique prompts**
- Responses collected from each of the 4 LLMs
- Data organized in a structured Excel sheet (`short_sentence.xlsx`)

## Models
- **Baseline**: Logistic Regression using BERT embeddings
- **Advanced**: RNN Classifier

### RNN Classifier Configuration
- **Input Size**: BERT embedding dimension
- **Hidden Size**: 128
- **Number of Layers**: 2
- **Number of Classes**: 4

## Key Findings
- **Overall Accuracy**:
  - Logistic Regression: 57.69%
  - RNN Classifier: 59.62%
- **Llama 3.1 405B** responses were the most distinctly identifiable.
- Sentence length correlates strongly with classification performance.

## Analysis Highlights
- Detailed performance metrics for each LLM.
- Confusion matrix analysis.
- In-depth study on the impact of sentence length on classification accuracy.

## Future Work
- Explore diverse prompting strategies.
- Construct more balanced datasets.
- Investigate advanced model architectures.
- Conduct larger scale studies with more LLMs.
